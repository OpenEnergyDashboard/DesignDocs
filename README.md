# DesignDocs

Holds documentation on OED, esp. design of features.

Note OED is transitioning to mostly public design documents. The private DevDocs repository has some design documents but the plan is to migrate them to this public repository over time.

## Active

- [testing/testing.md](./testing/testing.md): Documents how the testing data was generated into CSV files and gives the tests desired.
- [mergeMeterGroup.md](./MergeMeterGroup/mergeMeterGroup.md): Proposal to fuse the meter and group menus on graphic pages.
- [parameterOptimization.md](./parameterOptimization/parameterOptimization.md): Proposal to adjust parameters.
- [weather/weather.md](./weather/weather.md): Documents ideas on using weather data to normalize usage.
- [postgresQueryOptimization.md](./postgresQueryOptimization/postgresQueryOptimization.md): how to analyze time spent on OED queries and the results of doing this.
- [unitVaryTime/conversionsVaryTime.md](./unitVaryTime/conversionsVaryTime.md): Documents ideas on how to deal with conversions that vary with time including area, baseline, weather, etc.

- [UIEval/S22UIEval.md](./UIEval/S22UIEval.md): A UI eval of OED with suggestions from Spring 2022.
- [MQTT.md](./MQTT.md): Looking into integrating for meter data acquisition.
- [baseline/baseline.md](./baseline/baseline.md): Add the ability for an admin to add baselines to meters and for users to display on a graphic.
- [enhancementToGithubAction.md](./githubAction/enhancementToGithubAction.md): securing GitHub action information.

## Information

- [addTooltips/addTooltips.md](./addTooltips/addTooltips.md): Information on putting in more tooltips.
- [website/website.md](./website/website.md): Describes how the OED website data and images are created.

## Historical

All of these are in this archive/ directory

- [3DGraphic/3DGraphic.md](./archive/3DGraphic/3DGraphic.md): A new 3D graphic to show usage.
- [automatedTestData.md](./archive/automatedTestData.md): How to generate mathematical test data and use it in the CI testing.
- [areaNormalization/areaNormalization.md](./archive/areaNormalization/areaNormalization.md): Documents idea on allowing normalization by area but also probably relates to other normalizations to come.
- [color.md](./archive/color.md): Ideas and work around 2020 on choosing the colors of meters/groups for OED graphics.
- [csv.md](./archive/csv/csv.md): adding CSV file input to OED.

- [export.md](./archive/export.md): Ideas and work around 2021 on exporting raw line graphic data.
- [fast-ptAnalysis/fastPtModification.md](./archive/fast-ptAnalysis/fastPtModification.md): Ideas from 2021 to improve fast-pt to avoid potential performance issues and undesirable graphing results.
